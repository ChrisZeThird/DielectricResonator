# About this project

This is a serie of programs written to visualize the electric and magnetic fields of a dielectric resonator. During my so-called Research Project at University, my supervisor
suggested me to calculate the electric and magnetic fields produced by a dielectric resonator in the context of the control of quantum dots with a global magnetic field. I then
took this opportunity to produce figures to truly understand the physics behind this type of material and as a nice addition to my report.

# The files

You will find 4 different files:

- `dielectricResonator.py` : the main file that will produce the figure. You just have to execute it if you want to obtain the results that I got, you can also change the parameters
from there;

- `electromagField.py` : in this script, I defined the expression of the electric and magnetic fields for both in and out of the cavity;

- `dipoleField.py` : as its name suggests, this script gives the expression of the magnetic field generated by a rectangular magnetic dipole in the cartesian coordinates;

- `Cube3D.py` : this files is not necessary and you can simply comment or even delete the one line at the bottom of the main script if you do not want to see it. I found it useful to
enlight the volume occuppied by the DR to differentiate the fields line properly;
